As a teacher assistant, developed and taught the practical component of this graduate-level class for students of the Engineering Physics degree of University of Minho. The classes made use of the Haskell programming language and Qiskit for hands-on simulation and development of quantum algorithms. All course materials are available in the [course webpage](http://arca.di.uminho.pt/quantum-computation-1819/).

I - Simulation of quantum circuits with Haskell
======


II - Developing quantum algorithms with Qiskit
======
