If you are attending the hands-on session for the **Mission 10000** conference @INL, you can download the notebook file [HERE](https://afonsofr.github.io/files/hands_on_mission_10000.ipynb).




I currently work as quantum computing researcher and [teaching assistant](https://afonsofr.github.io/teaching/2019-qc-teaching/) in University of Minho, Dept. of Computer Science; I am also associated with [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/people/afonso-miguel-rodrigues) as an assistant researcher. My work includes:

* Continuing development of my master's project, on the subject of validation of quantum simulations;
* Application of quantum algorithms to "real-world" optimization problems;
* Developing teaching materials for the graduate-level Quantum Computation course, and other educational talks;
* Other collaborative work with fellow researchers from the HASLab group of INESC TEC, or from the quantum computation field.

Recent projects include [QArithmetic](https://github.com/hkhetawat/QArithmetic), a library of quantum algorithms for binary arithmetic operations in quantum circuits which is directly implementatable in Qiskit. This group project originated in [Qiskit Camp '19](https://qiskit.camp/) and it is still under development.

Feel free to contact me for all things quantum or academia related!
